Main goals
– A main page with all the messages
– A dedicated page for each message
– A sidebar with information about the current user
– A routing system
– A search bar to be able to filter the posts by date, user or some word inside the message

Notes from the slides:
DO NOT COPY THE DESIGN OF THIS SCREENSHOT !!! THIS IS AN EXAMPLE ONLY 😅
(Yes, it’s all caps, because every crossover, we have students who think they have to replicate this exact design 🤦‍♂️)

To-Do
– Generate new mock data with the new schema 
– Messages: Clarify if we can use the timestamp as ID for a single message or if the schema needs another kind of unique ID
– Routing system: Have a look at this sandbox maybe it's usefull https://codesandbox.io/s/useparams-useeffect-usestate-tcfzg?file=/src/App.js:0-23
– Define components and visualize them with mock data
– Replace favicon and logo
 
Let's split up?
Maybe it's better to split up and work on the single components to have some basic visual appearance.

Main page structure
– Set a logo to go back to the main page
– Sidebar left with user information
– Main containter with message feed (rename message component?)
– Searchbar on the right

Dedicated page structure 
– Show the single message
– Maybe not to run into the layout trap: 

Searchbar
– Where should it be?

Sidebar (optional)
– Mock UI elements 

Optional
– Lazyloading messages (intersectionobserver, suspense, lazy, pagination)
– one page to display all the users
– a fake page/modal to sign up/login (no real functionality, for now!)
